1. Why am I creating a docker image? I am attending a machine learning competition that can only runs online in a toolbox called "ShaXiang" that can only pull docker images. And I need to create a docker image and upload to the competition's designated docker hub(website).

2. What docker image I need? I need a docker image that can run Tensorflow-gpu with Cuda and cudnn installed, as well as keras installed.

3. How did I do? I have done it partially with a docker file created by others, installing a specified cudra and cudnn version, I can installed tensorflow by myself as well. However the problem is that the cuda and cudnn versions are not compatible for my tensorflow.

4. What problems do i have? I have problems finding nvidia/cuda image in the hub.docker.com for specific cuda and cudnn versions. Thus, what I have done in question 3 has some problems when running tensorflow.

5. What ideas do I have? Method 1: I have a ubuntu machine home, with everything installed. Probably we can export docker image from my local environment? Method 2: Using Dockerfile.

6. The following is the Dockerfile I am using but have problems with cuda and cudnn version in terms of tensorflow.

FROM nvidia/cuda:9.2-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu18.04
