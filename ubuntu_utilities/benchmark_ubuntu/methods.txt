sudo apt-get install sysbench

sysbench --test=cpu --cpu-max-prime=20000 run

--cpu-max-prime=20000 is optional, the default being 10000. I suggest to keep the default and fiddle with --max-requests instead (which is the number of operations performed) – MestreLion Mar 22 '16 at 17:29

Also note that by default this is a single-threaded test. For testing N cores you can use --num-threads=N, and compare results using the per-request statistics output. – MestreLion Mar 22 '16 at 17:31

Is there a place to compare the output to get relative performance? – jjxtra Sep 13 '19 at 22:33

With newer version, the --test= option can be omitted, just use sysbench cpu.... Otherwise sysbench 1.0.18 prints: WARNING: the --test option is deprecated. You can pass a script name or path on the command line without any options. – ckujau Feb 16 '20 at 22:30
